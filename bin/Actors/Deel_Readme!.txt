The JET3D community can use any of these models
free of charge. We only ask that "OtherWorlds InterActive" 
be credited properly for the model that is to be used. 
(ex: Manual credits, user map readme.txt files, and so on)

Note that the metalChest, first aid kit, and woodchest are not 
Animated.

The "shadow" is in part a concept (c) 2000, OtherWorlds InterActive. Since that time the
character has changed in design.
The spider has as well, as well as the mummy.

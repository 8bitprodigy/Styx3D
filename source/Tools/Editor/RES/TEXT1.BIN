jDesignerClassic11 2.7.1.1

Welcome to jDesignerClassic11, the original Jet3D 2.7.1.1 world editor.  

jDesignerClassic11 is part of the jStudioClassic11 suite of applications now being curated for the Windows 11 platform.

Originating in 1999, Jet3D introduced a unique real time 3D development environment. You build your world, and add your actors while the engine is running. There is no separate compilation step. Jet3D gives the developer instant feedback so that you can see the effect of your work without delay.

Developed by Eclipse Entertainment, Inc. in the late 1990s for Windows 98, Jet3D has been available for 3D enthusiasts at no charge (license fees apply for commercial use). 

Although impressive in its time, Jet3D now is being curated as a historical artifact – a museum piece that has been overtaken by newer operating systems, newer game development platforms, newer graphics cards, and newer DirectX rendering infrastructures. Nonetheless, Jet3D can give game enthusiasts and developers a glimpse of the old school methods used in game development decades ago.

Enjoy jDesignerClassic11
